Adds cargo types and industries available throughout the campaign into free play and adds some completely new production chains.



WARNINGS

 - Some existing production chains have been slightly altered - for instance, the tools factory now uses planks and steel instead of just planks - so be careful when adding the mod into an existing save game where might not have the options to quickly get the new requirements to the altered production buildings.



RECOMMENDATIONS

 - I recommend playing on a new map with size >= Large to fit all production chains comfortably. If your system allows you to use experimental map sizes, you should opt for one of those. In case you're wondering how to enable experimental map sizes, here's a tutorial video: https://youtu.be/QzEsygQoFgs
